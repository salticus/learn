extending_qml 
-------------

Extending qml using PySide. Adapted from Nokia documentation on extending qml using C++. Based on tutorial at
http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qml-extending.html

Two goals:
    1. Provide easily adaptable examples of qml extensions in Python.
    2. Provide examples of adapting C++ to PySide. Since C++ examples seem to be more plentiful than PySide examples, this may help Python developers learn to adapt C++ examples to PySide.

Also, gain a more fundamental understanding of Qt and Qml.
