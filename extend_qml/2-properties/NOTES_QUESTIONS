Questions
=========

Does PySide use native python lists instead of QList?
    http://qt.gitorious.net/pyside/pyside/blobs/d2cd71313d0c44eaffe4b38ab3f9ac6daa2c20cb/PySide/QtCore/qlist_conversions.h
        Seems to indicate that Lists are used instead of QList in PySide: that QList objects are just converted over.
Difference between QDeclarativeListReference and QDeclarativeListProperty?
    reference vs property?

    PySide API 2 Removed QString, following PyQt4, 4.7

Notes
=====

QDeclarativeListProperty
------------------------

Seems that PySide uses QtDeclarative.ListProperty instead of QDeclarativeListProperty

The only properties currently supported are: type, append, at, clear, count

see the source:
    PySide/QtDeclarative/pysideqmlregistertype.cpp:175-196, 4e47b328 "Bumping to revision 1.0.9"
    gotten under  https://github.com/PySide/BuildScripts.git

A 2010 posting from the PySide site claims that QDeclarativeListProperty can be exposed, then points to an example that uses ListProperty(QDeclarativeItemSubClassFoo, appendMethod)
